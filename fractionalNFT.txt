Fractional NFTs refer to a type of non-fungible token (NFT) that can be divided into smaller units or fractions. This allows multiple people to own a piece of a larger NFT, such as a digital artwork, and potentially opens up new opportunities for investment and ownership in the NFT space. However, it is also important to note that not all NFT platforms or creators support the concept of fractional ownership, and it is important to do research and understand the specific terms and conditions of any fractional NFTs you may be interested in purchasing
